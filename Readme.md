A paper that is customized for you and delivered daily.

## Development

### Requirements

* [nodenv](https://github.com/nodenv/nodenv)
* [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/)

### Commit Messages

All commit messages should use the Angular Git commit formatting so
that Semantic Release can determine what has changed and what the new
version is that should be released.

You can read more about the formatting on the Git commit messages
[here](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
